########## Discovering other services using Eureka Client ############

1. Create one more micro-service() and register that in eureka server. Then run 2 instances of that service.
2. Check the eureka dashboard http://localhost:8761/ after registering the service.

3. Now, invoke the micro-service() from this ctalog-service by using REST-TEMPLATE   

##########  Ribbon LoadBalancer  ##########  

> Run multiple instances of the micro-service()
> Consume/Call this micro-service() from catalog-service.
> We can register RestTemplate as a Spring bean with @LoadBalanced annotation. 
  The RestTemplate with @LoadBalanced annotation will internally use Ribbon LoadBalancer 
  to resolve the ServiceID and invoke REST endpoint using one of the available servers.
