# errorThresholdPercentage 
#This number controls when the requests should be short-circuited and not passed to downstream anymore.
#The default value is 50%. If at least 50% of previous requests failed, then no other request will be passed further
#and the fallback response will be served back.

# Propagate ThreadLocal variables: SEMAPHORE #
#By default, the methods with @HystrixCommand will be executed on a different thread because the default 
#execution.isolation.strategy is ExecutionIsolationStrategy.THREAD. So, the ThreadLocal variables we set before 
#invoking @HystrixCommand methods won\u2019t be available within @HystrixCommand methods.

#If you set the property execution.isolation.strategy to SEMAPHORE then Hystrix will use semaphores instead of threads 
#to limit the number of concurrent parent threads that invoke the command.

#Another option to make ThreadLocal variables available within Hystrix command methods is implementing our own 
#HystrixConcurrencyStrategy.
